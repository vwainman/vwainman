Hi! Welcome to my profile, my name is Vincent Wainman

I'm an aspiring data analyst and recent BCom graduate in MIS with a minor in computing science. 

I'm interested in all things tech with a special interest on innovative technologies that are up and coming.

I'm currently learning how to use the Dask framework with a relatively simple machine learning case study.
