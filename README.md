Hi! Welcome to my profile, my name is Vincent Wainman

I'm an aspiring data analyst and recent BCom graduate in MIS with a minor in computing science. 

I'm interested in all things tech with a special interest in the next big computing leap with machine learning and artificial intelligence. 

I'm currently learning how to use the Dask framework with a relatively simple machine learning case study.
